## Usage

### Config files

See *test/dummy/doc/api_doc.yml* for an example YAML config file.

This project is a work in progress, and doesn't hold your hand with validating the config file format yet.
It's current supported format is: (nodes named with <> are to be named whatever you like)

Use the rails convention of specifying dynamic url paramaters via `:id`

```yml
api:
  <version_number>:
    defaults:
      domain: api.example.com
      protocol: http
      ...
    <namespace>:
      description: "..."
      detail:      "..."
      formats: "json, xml"
      authentication:
        type: basic
        user: admin
        password: password
      resources:
        <users>:
          description: "..."
          actions:
            <update>:
              http_method: POST
              uri: /users/:id
              description: "..."
              parameters:
                <id>:
                  type: integer
                  example: 1
                <account_type>:
                  type: string
                  default: personal
                <nested_record>:
                  <nested_attr>:
                    type: string
                    example: test@example.com
```

### Routes
Add to your application's routes.rb:

```ruby
mount EasyApiDoc::Engine => "/api_docs"
```

## Options
Put your options in an initializer, like *config/initializers/easy_api_doc.rb*

Example:

```ruby
EasyApiDoc.options do |options|
  # options here
end
```

### Authentication
By default authentication is non-existent and anyone can access the docs.
You can specify authentication like so...

```ruby
options.authenticate_with do
  authenticate_user!
end
```

Whatever you pass to `authenticate_with` is evaluated as a before_filter on EasyApiDoc controllers.
The example above uses the Devise method `authenticate_user!`

### Authorization
There is no authorization unless specified. Anyone can access anything.

#### Custom
Whatever you pass to `authorize_with` is evaluated as a before_filter on EasyApiDoc controllers.

```ruby
options.authorize_with do
  redirect_to root_path unless user.is_admin?
end
```

#### CanCan
You can use [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) to authorize access.

You need to send `:cancan` to the `authorize_with` option. You *must* also send (as a second parameter) the name of the method used to access the current user. e.g. with Devise this is `current_user`.

```ruby
options.authorize_with :cancan, :current_user
```
